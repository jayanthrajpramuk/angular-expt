Section 3 :
----------
Building Blocks : -> Components , templates , directives and services.

every application has atleat 1 module (app module).
when application grows this app module will have many child modules.
Each module will have 1 or more components.
Gloria Application : GloriaModule --> procModule , recieveModule , .... each module will have
atleast 1 component

3 steps : create , register , add html markup

Installing angular 4 : npm install -g @angular/cli@1.4.10, This will help whenever we wnat to install Angular 4 project. Especially the dependencies

USing components we can extend the html library.
if we want <div id="courses"> selector will be #courses
if we want <div class="courses"> selector will be .courses
if we want <courses></courses> selector will be courses


regarding html rendering :
identify the html tag -> <courses></courses>

then go to currosponding mapped component. then go to mapped html . this is what will be rendered in the page. but not the content inside th ecourses tag.

its like put the contents which is present in component html in index html selector tag.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

ie put the content present in app.component.html in app-root selector

QUESTION : Y IT DOESNT PICK THE HTML TAG AND SEARCH COMPONENT FROM THE INDEX.html
bootstrapping multiple is not possible. Mutiple child views are possible though
it depends on which component we give for bootstrapping

ng g c "component-name"


why asterisk infront of directive ??

The component should should not include any logic other than the presentation logic.

there is no decorater for service.


we can register a service only for a perticular component in the decorater(provider) or we can
also register in the module in provider
so that all the components inside the module will be able to access the service.

ng g s "serviceName"
angular automatically appends 'service'

injectable : is need when a perticular service is in need of other dependency. then it needs
injectable. if there is none then there is no need. but its BP to add.

But we do not need in component as it is internally included.
