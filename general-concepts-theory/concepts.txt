Modules in Java Scripts:
- helps in encapsulation. Giving only those which we need publicly.
- export only what you need and import only those what we need.

SystemJS :
- it will actually help us to load only those JS files which are actually necesary to
do a perticular operation by using import and export statements and a configuration file for systemJS
